# logic-for-computer-scientists-DD1351
Prolog programming and application of different logics.Lab1 implemented various short pieces of code, where the aim was to gain an understanding of Prolog as a language and its use.
In lab 2, a proof system for propositional logic is implemented and in lab3, a Model Testing for CTL is implemented, i.e. software tools that check different temporal logic formulas using temporal logic rules.
